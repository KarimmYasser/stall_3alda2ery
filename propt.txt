@top_level_processor.vhd @tb_top_level_execute.vhd @run_top_level_execute.do this tb run the simulation of the top_level_preocessor  by forcing instrucion to the fetch stage but now i connected the@test_output_hex.mem  with the memory _unit@memory_unit.vhd  such that instrucions are loaded from the assembler now i am tired of seeing the wave fore and test the values espically after adding the memory i want to see if the instruction like push and pop read and write correctly form the memory , our arch is vonnnumensuch that data and instrutions are loaded in the same memory, so i need the testbench to 1) show the instruction from teh memory not the forced instrction of the tb 2) show the memory values of such that to see the                                      if the data inserted is coerrect and 3) assert the final values of outputs of each instruction to to match the expected value of the registerfile @reg_file.vhd  registers and memory locations and pc @pc.vhd value to the expected value the @control_unit.vhd here demonstrat the instructions opcode and these photos shows what should be done when inserting and instrution and  here is the  assembler @assembler.py  that outputs the instructions as binarty and hexavalues
